# Summary

## Background

This is transcription of the judicial declaration in the case 2019-CP-42-03679, Glenlake Upstate Homeowners Association, Inc., Plaintiff, v. Spallone, regarding their denial to pay HOA dues. The homeowners's reasoning was that, due to the annexation issue in the HOA documents, they were not legally bound to pay the dues or even be a part of the Associaton. 

## Outcome

In the judicial declaration by the 7th Judicial Circuit of South Carolina in case 2019CP4203679 (Glenlake Upstate Homeowners Association, Inc. VS a homeowner, defendant, et al) on March 29, 2021, the judge concluded that all property in Phase 2C is bound to the Covenants, despite the lateness in issuing the Fourth Amendment to the CC&R.

By precedent, this also means that all of the other phases that were annexed post-Fourth Amendment (i.e. Phases 3C, 4B, 4C, 5A and 5B), are to be considered covered by the Covenants because they follow the judge's logic:

i. Previously owned by the developer as part of a single lot of land intended to be a single subdivision
i. Covenants were in place when the property was sold
i. During the home sale, buyers were aware of the Covenants and the Association
i. The buyers use the common areas
i. The buyers paid the assessments before 2019, acknowledging the existence and validity of the authority of the HOA.

## Conclusion

In the opinion of the Glenlake Upstate Homeowners Association and its legal counsel, this judgement achieves the goals set forward by the board in 2018 to correct the issues around annexation and concludes all activity around these issues.
